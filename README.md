# Workshop on Landslide Susceptibility Modeling with R at the 2024 AGR Conference

This repo contains the lecture slides, R code and data related to a workshop held at the [39th Romanian Symposium on Geomorphology](https://sng.geomorfologie.ro/) in Iasi in September 2024, organized by the Romanian Association of Geomorphologists (AGR). Contents are protected by copyright.

These materials are also part of a course on geospatial machine learning (GEO408B) that I teach in the Master's program in [Geographic Information Science](https://www.uni-jena.de/msc-geoinformatik) (*Geoinformatik*) at Friedrich Schiller University Jena.
